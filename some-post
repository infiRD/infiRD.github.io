You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build
the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but
the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web
server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
